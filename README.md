# CI for Python with Travis.org
![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/ddmee/travis-git-python.svg?branch=master)

Travis.org provides open-source projects with a free CI facility. 

This repository is playing around with Travis and Github, to automatically test the contained python code.

Goals:
1. Automatically build and test all commits
2. Prevent commits to master that have not passed the tests.
